# Patent text analytics and venture-backed innovation

Tensorflow-Keras neural networks of venture capital/corporate innovations research

Tools used: Tensorflow/Keras, PlaidML (for GPU), and Hyperas for hyperparameter tuning.

This repository contains a series of predictive objects made using the data from my finance research paper ["Patent text analytics and Venture-backed Innovation."](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sqighkgCou1QalQ04polmRmMXUBmQOJN) The research finds that venture-backed portfolio companies which produce patents that are textually more similar to those of their industry peers produce more patents and higher quality patents, as quality is measured by the number of citations by other patents. 4.9 million cosine similarity measures between the patents of 961 venture-backed portfolio companies from 28 different nations provide results that are able to generalize beyond the English language with the addition of a cultural-linguistic distance measure from [West and Graham (2004)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C9&q=west+and+graham+2004+linguistic+distance&btnG=).

Although inferential statistics are the standard in academic business research, a great deal of econometrics applies to neural networks. My dissertation chapters each made use of left-censored tobits that are essentially inferential versions of ReLUs from neural networks. [A co-authored journal publication of mine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YSCRUzk6HGscBfy7aj-S1EEhfUfNJ0IQ/view?usp=sharing) has made use of structural equation models, [which are inferential versions of causal Bayesian neural networks](http://causality.cs.ucla.edu/blog/index.php/2012/12/07/on-structural-equations-versus-causal-bayes-networks/) where the path weights are of interest, rather than prediction on new data.

Despite the focus in finance research on inferential statistics, predictive analytics are increasingly being used in practice and in the area of venture capital. For example, [Google Ventures](https://www.axios.com/scoop-inside-google-venure-capital-machine-ce7782f2-a9b4-4556-8feb-0914e77ac021.html) actively uses machine learning to predict whether or not a venture capital investment should be undertaken. [Other](https://www.wsj.com/articles/signalfire-raises-330-million-for-data-centric-venture-capital-1494415804) venture capital firms are beginning to follow suit as well as [venture capital shifts overseas](https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/05/u-s-share-of-global-venture-capital-fell-more-than-20-in-5-years/amp/). To that end, and to take the opportunity to apply neural networks to [research-quality data](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/05/29/research-quality-data-and-research-quality-databases/), I have made predictive objects from my research available for practitioners.
