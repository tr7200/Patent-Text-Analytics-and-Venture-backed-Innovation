# Predictions

A jupyter notebook here shows how to predict on new data and includes a short data dictionary (see the [research paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sqighkgCou1QalQ04polmRmMXUBmQOJN) for further details).

There is also a command line script that may be used to create your own cosine similarity variable. The script takes a CSV file with your patent's description as input and accepts arguments for the SDC Platinum category into which the patent belongs as well as the number of patents to compare it with to obtain the cosine similarity measure.
